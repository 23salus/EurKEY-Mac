2023-02-25:

It has been more than a year now that I no longer have Apple hardware.
I am using Linux exclusively and I do not anticipate the situation changing in
the foreseeable future, therefore I'm unable to keep updating the macOS port
and I'm forced to archive it for now. I could still accept submissions, but I
have a policy of not publishing anything I don't use or can't test myself.

Don't let it discourage you, though; unless you benefit from the [changes made
in version 1.3](https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/changelog.html) (in beta
for many years now â€” it might as well be considered released *de facto* at this
point) the layout you'll find here remains as useful as ever and will not "rot",
at least not until Apple decides to break the keyboard layout format in a future
version of macOS.

EurKEY-Mac
==========

The Keyboard Layout for Europeans, Coders and Translators - Version for Mac OS X.

This is a port of the [EurKEY Keyboard layout](http://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/), which features a QWERTY baseline layout (=good access to braces etc.) with quick access to commonly used accented characters and Umlauts.

**Status**: The whole layout should be mapped now. Please report if you find any missing characters.


Install
=======

Copy the two files `EurKEY.keylayout` and `EurKEY.icns` to your library, either system-wide (`/Library/Keyboard Layouts`) or for your local user (`~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`). A system-wide installation is preferred though to ensure the layout is available to all applications. (See also [this Superuser answer](https://superuser.com/a/561613/263461).)
